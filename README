# PassChecker

A small cmdline script to check your passwords against (currently)
https://haveibeenpwned.com databases

# How to use:

python ./pwd-check.py

(subject to change)

# TODO
- use other databases with other disclosures and switch the haveibeenpwned API as well
- have a script to wipe the console history (as inputting the password would )
- a gui?

Migrate to v3 of api
https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3
